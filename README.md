# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Machine-Learning-


Developed and evaluated customer churn prediction models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost on a real-world telecom dataset.

Applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and addressed class imbalance with SMOTE.

Implemented 5-fold stratified cross-validation achieving an average ROC-AUC of 0.82, identifying key churn drivers like contract type and monthly charges.
